# VisionTransformer

This repository is dedicated to replicating the Vision Transformer (ViT) as described in the original paper: An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale.

Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to create a structured approach to replicating AI papers, starting with the Vision Transformer. This process involves:

Understanding the architecture: Analyzing and breaking down the ViT model architecture as presented in the paper.
Finding hyperparameters: Identifying the relevant hyperparameters from the paper and integrating them into the implementation.
Data processing: Replicating the exact input data preprocessing pipeline, including patch embeddings and tokenization, as described in the paper.
Model replication: Coding each part of the architecture and ensuring that the behavior matches the results found in the paper.
Testing and validation: Ensuring the replicated model is tested against the same benchmarks provided in the paper.
Approach
Architecture Diagram: Start by drawing the architecture diagram based on the details from the paper.
Hyperparameter Setup: Identify the critical hyperparameters and input data characteristics from the paper.
Implementation: Implement each component of the Vision Transformer step-by-step.
Experimentation: Run experiments and compare results with the benchmarks provided in the original paper.
Requirements
Python 3.7+
PyTorch
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
